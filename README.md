# FinancalAidForCoursera



I am a student from XXX who is very interested in the XXX course on Coursera. However, I do not have the financial means to pay for the certificate on my own. I am currently living only on my scholarship, and it is very difficult for me to gather the amount of money needed for the certificate.

Receiving Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. It will open up new horizons for me in the world of Coursera courses, which will, in turn, help me in the future. As one of three brothers who are all at the learning stage, it becomes difficult for our family members to pay for all of our courses, and adding mine will make it even harder for them to pay.

Taking this course will provide me with the opportunity to learn XXX and increase my knowledge about the subject, which will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help me perform better in carrying out various programs in a computer language and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will also attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course.

I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. I also intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. Additionally, I plan to grade assignments which are to be peer-reviewed which I believe will be an invaluable learning opportunity.

Lastly, I would like to mention that the financial status of my family is not too good to pay the loan amount. We already have a lot of debt in the bank, and my parents are paying it on a regular basis. It would make their life even harder to add a new loan over them. I do not want to put any pressure over them. It would be a great help for me to get a good job and help my family if I am able to get this course.

Thank you for considering my application for financial aid. I hope to hear a positive response from you soon.
